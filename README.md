- 👋 Hi, I’m @joseantonio400
- 👀 I’m interested in website building and software programming since the olden days of the old B.A.S.I.C. Unfortunately VB6 is no longer recognized.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning css and responsive websites.
- 💞️ I try to collaborate with human beings. I do not work in a corporate environment or with commercial intentions.
- 📫 you can reach me by looking for joseantonio400 on the internet. I prefer dialogues in 'pt-br' language.
- 👀 https://www.filosofiapopular.com.br and https://www.saraus.com.br/ are my current jobs.
- - 💞️ I'm interested that GITHUB experts create a platform to "search website" to get rid of Google commercials in "Google search".
